## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

What coding skills are expected 2020 in Germany? Compared by full-time employees on Stack Overflow

- Which language do the participants plan to work with in 2020?
- Which database do the participants plan to work with in 2020?
- Which plattform do the participants plan to work with in 2020?
- Does the professional coding experience have an impact on salary?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  This notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/p/e19281dddf6b/).
